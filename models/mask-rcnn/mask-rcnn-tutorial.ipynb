It should be unique\n","        between all the images in the dataset, and is used during\n","        evaluation\n","    -   `area`, float `torch.Tensor`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} of\n","        shape `[N]`: the area of the bounding box.

The model considers class `0` as background.\n","If your dataset does not contain the background class, you should not\n","have `0` in your `labels`. For example, assuming you have just two\n","classes, *cat* and *dog*, you can define `1` (not `0`) to represent\n","*cats* and `2` to represent *dogs*. So, for instance, if one of the\n","images has both classes, your `labels` tensor should look like `[1, 2]`.\n","\n","Additionally, if you want to use aspect ratio grouping during training\n","(so that each batch only contains images with similar aspect ratios),\n","then it is recommended to also implement a `get_height_and_width`\n","method, which returns the height and the width of the image. If this\n","method is not provided, we query all elements of the dataset via\n","`__getitem__` , which loads the image in memory and is slower than if a\n","custom method is provided.\n","\n","Writing a custom dataset for PennFudan\n","--------------------------------------\n","\n","Let's write a dataset for the PennFudan dataset.
